## :pushpin: _How does the application work?_

On the leader board there are results for Top 5 Players saved in Firebase.

You can save your name or play anonymously as User.

Choose Rock Paper or Scissors and computer chooses randomly.

You can play and get scores until the computer wins.

If you get more scores than one of Top 5 Players from the leaderboard, 

your name and scores saves in Firebase and shows on the leaderboard.

When the game is over, you can reset the game with the same name or reset the name too.

Attention! If application doesn't work, this could happen because of changed database rules.
